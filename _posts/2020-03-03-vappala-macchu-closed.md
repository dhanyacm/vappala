Regret to inform the sad demise of Vappala Radhavilas Radhabhai Amma (99) w/o Late K Balakrishna Menon today afternoon. She was the oldest member of Vappala family and was ailing for some time.

Due to this the Vappala Machu will remain closed for 2 weeks.

Please note that since the machu is closed because of pela, the monthly pooja of Meenam month is postponed to 12th April 2020 and will not be held on the first Sunday.
